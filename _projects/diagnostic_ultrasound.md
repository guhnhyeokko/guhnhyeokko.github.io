## Overview

RBC aggregation is an important rheological factor for predicting and diagnosing circulatory diseases. Many experimental and computational studies have been conducted. However, most in vivo and in-vitro studies were performed under steady Poiseuille flow. In our lab, we investigate the relationship between shear rate and RBC aggregation considering the spatial distribution under pulsatile flow.
